# dyn_module_info

This OpenERP/Odoo module adds more information to the module form for installed modules:

* Models (re)defined in the module
* Fields (re)defined in the module
* Data records belonging to the module

To do:
Add more relevant info to the standard stuff (views, menus, reports) and also present as tables. Perhaps change the layout of the notepad to better group stuff together.
